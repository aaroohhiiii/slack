THIS IS HE COMPILATION OF ALL THE MISTKED I WILL MAKE SO THAT I ACNA KEEP TTRACK OF MYSELF 


AND MY LEARNUNG TOO 


"dev" : "node -watch server.js" this plays the server evrytime there are changes in the file 

"start" : "nodeserver.js"

we install ndemon as the devdependiecies then we can replace node -watch wth modemon 
in env file the port=5001 and nit port = 5001 



if we jut write app.listen in our server.js it wil llisten foever and vercel doesn want you to dp that 


when we create ir delete user we beened tqo tell that to stream too so it can manage the dsta od the user thats wh stream.hs is created
